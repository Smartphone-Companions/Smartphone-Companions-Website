Even if today’s smartphones offer a “do not disturb” function, it is based on an all-or-nothing logic. DND (do not disturb) allows you to manage the different notification flows by defining certain rules via an app on your smartphone. These rules can then be enabled and disabled via a peripheral object, connected to the smartphone. This object allows a simple selection and can be found on our table or in our pocket.
