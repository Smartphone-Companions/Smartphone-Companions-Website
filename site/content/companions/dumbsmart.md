Between smartphone and dumbphone the gap is radical, from always connected, full of apps and services to almost off-grid. For someone who wants to change back to a less connected device the choice is limited. And maybe stepping down with connectivity does not mean that you want to loose GPS location and map services. By using the Switchbox the user is able to change the functionalities of the phone between four presets: Reporter, Traveller, Explorer, Wanderer, from fully connected to almost Off-the-grid.
