title: About the project
---
Over the last decade, a small object has radically changed our behavior, our means of communication and our attention. This research project proposes to explore new forms of interaction with the data flows passing through our smartphone, questioning the status of all-encompassing object that this device has acquired.

Through a prospective approach, the project Smartphone Peripheral Companions tackles the relationship we have developed with our smartphones and more specifically how we interact with the data flows to which they give us access. This research through designaims at imagining objects and interfaces allowing a detachment from the smartphone or stimulating a more balanced and focused interaction with some of its functionalities in desired situations.

So much of contemporary culture and interactions is taking place through interfaces; interfaces are part of cultural expression and participation. Therefore, questioning the impact of the mechanisms underlying current smartphone interfaces is also a societal interest.

By imagining, designing and prototyping new objects or apparatuses, this project aims to offer proposals for re-appropriation, re-extraction of certain features locked in the smartphone, thereby allowing a different, more customizable access to data or functions. Consequently, fostering a shift from the glowing rectangle to a more detached and focused interaction, away from the screen.

**Goals**

Through its approach, the project aims to offer a reflection on our relationship to this ultra- contemporary object that is the smartphone by questioning some of its uses through a series of objects. The problematic uses of the smartphone are increasingly thematised in the press, scientific journals, books, etc. However, there is still too little reflection within the design community on these issues (interaction design, interface design and product design).

The project aims, through its results, to:

* thematise the current problems around smartphones in the form of design proposals
* provide reflective inspiration for the design community
* offer concrete proposals (in the form of a kit and instructions) allowing a certain re- appropriation and access to certain smartphone functionalities (in particular notifications).
