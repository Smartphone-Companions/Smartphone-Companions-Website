title: About the project
---
Over the last decade, a small object has radically changed our behavior, our means of communication and our attention. This research project proposes to explore new forms of interaction with the data flows passing through our smartphone, questioning the status of all-encompassing object that this device has acquired.

The Research Project is conducted by Alain Bellet, Lison Christe and Martin Hertig at[ ECAL/University of Art and Desing Lausanne](< https://ecal.ch>)
